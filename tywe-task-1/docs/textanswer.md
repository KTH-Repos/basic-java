Exercise 1.33

Write the signature for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.

*Answer: void name (string)*


Assistant's note: If you feel confused about what a method signature should look like, you are not alone, because the authors of Objects First with Java are too! In the 5th edition, the definition on page 7 is incorrect. This has been fixed in the 6th edition, but they have left out a concrete example and mix it up again later in the book. For the correct definition with example, see Defining Methods from Oracle's Java documentation. Both versions will be accepted, but do note that it is the one from the Oracle documentation that is actually correct.

Exercise 1.34

Write the signature for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.

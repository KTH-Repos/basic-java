# Game Documentation

### Theme
As the name of the game suggests, the theme is to find your way out of a shopping mall.
The game character Sam is lost and you have to help him find the exit of the mall so he can go
catch the buss home. The game begins in the "CoffeeShop" room and using simple
command words you try to help Sam navigate the shopping mall until he finds the "ExitDoor"
room.

### How to win/lose
You have to find the exit door with room enters less than 20. That means the character has to be
able to find his way out of the shopping mall before he has entered 20 other rooms prior to getting in to
the exit door.

### Extensions
This game depends heavily on the "World of Zuul" application. The original classes are all in this
application. But there are two additional classes included in "Find your way": GameMap and Player.
GameMap has all the information about the rooms in the game. It holds the rooms' names and their exits.
Player holds all the info about the character of the game. The character has only 20 room enters before the
game ends in defeat.



INFO FOR TA;

The game is not complete as it has no ending.

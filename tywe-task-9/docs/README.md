##### Exercise s.6: Come up with one or more further optimizations that could be made to the algorithm. 

##### Answer: 
I dont know if this hasn't been implemented in the java code
but its directly taken from the wikipedia page provided in 
task 9. 

"As a refinement, it is sufficient to mark the numbers  
from p^2, as all the smaller multiples of p will have 
already been marked at that point. This means that the 
algorithm is allowed to terminate when 
p2 is greater than n."



##### Note to TA:

For exercise 7.18 I have changed the accessor modifier of the 
findCommentByAuthor method to public to create much efficient 
unit testing. 

For exercise s.5 I have tried to solve the problem as I understood it.
The problem was not so clear.
